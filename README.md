# FastAPI Python API

Welcome to the FastAPI Python API project! This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for building web APIs using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

## Project Overview

This project is based on the [FreeCodeCamp Python API Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) on building a Python API with FastAPI. It covers the following key aspects:

- Setting up a FastAPI project.
- Creating endpoints to handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Request and response models using Pydantic.
- Data validation and serialization.
- Dependency injection.
- Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- SQLAlchemy integration for working with databases.
- Testing using Pytest.
- Docker containerization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
- Familiarity with basic Python concepts.
- Basic knowledge of RESTful API concepts.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) knowledge is a plus.

## Getting Started
